/*You are a runner, and you are in training for a race. 
You'd like to keep track of all of your times for your training runs. 
You only like to run around lakes. Here's some example data,

Calhoun, 45.15
Calhoun, 43.32
Harriet,  49.34
Harriet, 44.43
Harriet, 46.22
Como, 32.11
Como, 28.14
Please write a program which enables you to enter the names of lakes and times, 
and store it all of this data in data structure(s). 
Don't store it in individual variables. 
Your program should still work if you started running around another lake too (e.g. Cedar or Phalen).
Your program should be able to analyze the data that you have stored, 
and print your fastest time for each lake you ran around. So, for this data, your program will display
Calhoun, 43.32
Harriet, 44.43
Como, 32.11*/

//Modify this program to use objects to store the data. What class(es) will you create?  
//Again, your classes should improve your program's organization, conciseness, clarity and structure.
